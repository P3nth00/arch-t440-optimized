❓ Frequently Asked Questions
1. Can I dual boot with Windows?
Yes! Shrink Windows partition with gparted and leave free space for Arch.

2. The T440 touchpad is bad. How to improve it?
We recommend replacing it with the T450 model (with physical buttons).

3. How to update the system later?
bash
sudo pacman -Syu
